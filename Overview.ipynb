    "### 1: Topic Proposals\n",
    "\n",
    "Background: I started this course in part to learn the mechanics of self-driving car autonomy. I enjoyed the topic and building my cars, but when it came to programming I felt somewhat out of depth. As I looked into the subject I realized that I could benefit from a solid foundation in a data science and machine learning. Thus, when I was granted the freedom to choose my own topic for my capstone project, this is where I went.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first check-in took the form of a 3-5 minute lightning talk, in which I was to outline three ideas for my capstone. The three I chose were:\n",
    "1. Self-Driving Car (\"Real\")\n",
    "1. Self-Driving Car (Simulated)\n",
    "1. NHTSA Traffic Safety vs. State Policy\n",
    "\n",
    "\\#3 what not something I was particularly excited about, but I used it as a backup of sorts if the first two ideas were rejected. As it was, the course instructors were enthused about both \\#1 and \\#2, though they correctly pointed out that \\#1 would have been \"very very difficult\" given the time constraints of the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, I decided to go with \\#2."
